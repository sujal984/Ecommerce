first we have to create a database and table named user where :
we  will use postgres here 
userid primary auto increatement
username varchar(20)
password varchar(200)
role varchar(40)
status boolean
created_at 
  then connect it to the server then make post api to reacieve data from user 
  then make query to insert that recieved data from user to the database
